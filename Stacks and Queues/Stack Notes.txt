Stack
- good analogy is a can of tennis balls
- push item to the top of a stack 
- can only remove the top item (most recently added) from the stack 
- pop item to remove it from stack 
- LIFO (last in first out)

- common way of implementing a stack is by using an array
- adding or removing from the end of an array is an O(1) operation
- adding or removing from the beginning is an O(n) operation

- we will use a linked list for implementing stacks 
- left side of linked list (starting with head) will be the top of the stack 
- null terminated end is at the bottom of the stack 
- removing item from end of linked list is O(n), adding an item is O(1)
- removing and adding item at beginning are both O(1)

- we will rename head and tail of linked list to top and bottom instead 
- we can just remove bottom (tail) instead
