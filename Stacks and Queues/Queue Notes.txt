Queues
- add to back to of queue (enqueue), remove from front of queue (dequeue)
- FIFO (first in first out)
- just like a stop sign or a line 

- could use array for a queue
- one end of array will be front and one will be back, doesn't matter which
- adding or removing from front is O(n)
- adding or removing from back is O(1)

- could use linked list for a queue
- adding and removing from front are both O(1)
- adding to back is O(1), removing from back is O(n)
- best solution is to make the head of linked list the front of the line
- tail of linked list is the back of the line
    - enqueue from the end (add)
    - dequeue fron the front (remove)
- this way both operations are O(1) 
- change head and tail to first and last
